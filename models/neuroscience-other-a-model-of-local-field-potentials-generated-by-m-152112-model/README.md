## Description

{"value": "A computational model of local field potentials generated by medial superior olive neurons. These field potentials are known as the \"auditory neurophonic\". MSO neuron is modeled as a soma


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the modeldb repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
